I am a second year Ph.D. Student in Computer Science both affiliated with The Kahlert School of Computing [SoC](https://www.cs.utah.edu) and Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute [SCI](https://www.sci.utah.edu/) at The University of Utah. I am advised by [Dr. Varun Shankar](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~shankar/) under the [Utah Digital Twin Lab](https://digitaltwin.cs.utah.edu/) and [Dr. Shandian Zhe](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~zhe/).

My research interests include, but are not limited to:
* SciML: Operator Learning, Physics-informed ML 
* Probabalistic Learning
* kernel methods

Previously I completed my masters at Durham University, where my thesis investigated novel methods for modeling irregular & multivariate time series data of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the goal of improving existing reverberation mapping techniques. A poster I presented for this work at UChicago's [AI + Science Summer School](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/events/ai-science-summer-school-2023/) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTejV4YIXShOr6Lx56WlS0E73Dhya-NTqcycXGygBc3mflo6bYvwq2xEEx9z8F1TdwIh358MqnDkxbJ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000).

Some of my recent graduate coursework:
* Probabalistic Machine Learning (CS 6190)
* Advanced Scientific Computing II (CS 6220)
* Computational Geometry (CS 6160)
* Advanced Optimization Algorithms (ECE 6960)
